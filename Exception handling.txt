try: the 'try' keywordis used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. It means we can't try block alone.the try block must be followed by either catch or finally.

catch: the "catch " block is used to handle the exception. it must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch alone. it can be followed by finally block later.

finally: The finally bolck is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
